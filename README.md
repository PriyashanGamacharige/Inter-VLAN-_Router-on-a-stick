# Inter-VLAN Router-on-a-Stick

This repository contains a **Cisco Packet Tracer lab** demonstrating **Inter-VLAN communication** using the **Router-on-a-Stick** configuration.  
It shows how multiple VLANs on a switch can communicate through a single router interface with subinterfaces and trunking.
